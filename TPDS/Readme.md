To run TPDS, we need to install GrowingSOM package.

TPDS first uses self organising map to get an estimate of manifold. Hence first the command to estimate manifold using SOM is run 
using TPDS_map() function.
After estimation of initial som based neighborhood another function "TPDS_vis()" is used.
